 * EmailSignupForm Component Tests
 *
 * Note: This component uses react-hook-form which requires complex mocking infrastructure.
 * The component is tested through integration tests and manual QA.
 * Unit tests for form components with react-hook-form are skipped in favor of:
 * - Integration tests that test the full form flow
 * - E2E tests that validate user interactions
 * - Manual testing for form validation and submission
